# EC2-Virtual-Machine
A cloud-based app that lets users launch AWS EC2 VMs by submitting a simple React form. The Node.js backend uses the AWS SDK to create instances and returns the public IP. A user data script auto-installs Apache and hosts a welcome page, making the VM a ready-to-use lab environment accessible via browser.
